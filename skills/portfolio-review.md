# Skill — Portfolio Review

**Stage:** 3 — Stress-Test
**Hook:** Your portfolio looked different at 3.5% interest rates. Run it at 7%.
**Use when:** You want to stress-test your existing property portfolio against rate rises, vacancy, and market changes — and understand what to do next.

---

## Purpose

This skill produces a structured portfolio stress test across all properties in a portfolio. It identifies the combined cash flow position, the most vulnerable properties, and the questions to prepare for conversations with a broker and accountant about portfolio management.

---

## Reads from

- Multiple Property Files (one per property, if maintained)
- Investor Profile: income, liabilities, investment objectives

## Writes to

- Standalone portfolio stress test document (does not write to individual Property Files)

> **Running this standalone:** This skill is self-contained. If you don't have Property Files or the paired skills listed below, just fill in the Inputs block — that's all this skill needs. The "Reads from" and "Pairs with" references are optional extras, not requirements.

## Inputs required

For each property in the portfolio:

```
PROPERTY [1/2/3...]:
- Address/suburb, state
- Purchase price: $[X]
- Current estimated value: $[X] (estimate — verify with agent or valuer)
- Loan balance: $[X]
- Interest rate: [%]
- Loan type: [IO / P&I]
- IO expiry date: [if applicable]
- Weekly rent: $[X]
- Vacancy (weeks per year): [X]
- Annual outgoings: $[X]

INCOME POSITION:
- Gross annual income: $[X]
- Approximate marginal tax rate: [32.5% / 37% / 45%]

OVERALL QUESTION:
- [What are you trying to understand: can I handle a rate rise? Can I add another property? Should I sell one?]
```

## Output contract

Return exactly these 6 sections:

### 1. PORTFOLIO SNAPSHOT
A summary table of all properties:

| Property | Estimated value | Loan | LVR | Equity | Weekly rent | Weekly cost | Pre-tax weekly |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [suburb 1] | $X | $X | X% | $X | $X | $X | +/- $X |
| [suburb 2] | $X | $X | X% | $X | $X | $X | +/- $X |
| **Total** | $X | $X | X% | $X | $X | $X | +/- $X |

> Note: Estimated values are provided by the user — not a formal valuation.

### 2. STRESS TEST SCENARIOS
Run the portfolio under 4 scenarios:

| Scenario | Rate change | Vacancy change | Combined weekly cash flow | Annual impact |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Current | 0% | Current | $X | — |
| Rate +1% | +1% | Current | $X | +/- $X |
| Rate +2% | +2% | Current | $X | +/- $X |
| Vacancy stress | 0% | +4 weeks/property | $X | +/- $X |
| Bear case | +2% | +4 weeks | $X | +/- $X |

### 3. INTEREST-ONLY EXPIRY RISK
Flag any IO loans expiring within 24 months:
- Property: [X]
- IO expiry: [month/year]
- Current weekly repayment (IO): $X
- Estimated weekly repayment (P&I after expiry): $X
- **Weekly cash flow impact at expiry:** +/- $X

If IO loans are expiring, this is a key item for your broker conversation.

### 4. EQUITY POSITION
- Total estimated equity across portfolio: $X
- Usable equity at 80% LVR: $X (estimated)
- Properties with highest equity concentration: [list]
- Properties at highest LVR risk: [list]

> Usable equity = (Current value × 80%) - Current loan balance. This is an estimate. A formal valuation and lender assessment are required to access equity.

Add an after-tax holding-cost line using the collected marginal tax rate:
- Portfolio pre-tax weekly cash flow: +/- $X
- Estimated tax effect of net rental loss (negative gearing): the pre-tax annual rental loss × marginal tax rate, expressed weekly = $X/week benefit
- **Estimated after-tax weekly holding cost:** +/- $X

> Assumption — verify with a registered tax agent. Only the interest portion of a P&I loan (not principal) is deductible; the tax benefit applies to genuine rental losses on a property genuinely available for rent, and depends on your actual marginal rate.

### 5. PORTFOLIO FLAGS
List the key risks and questions the stress test has surfaced:
- "IO loan on [property] expiring [date] — raise with broker"
- "Bear case cash flow requires $X/week from income — can you sustain that?"
- "LVR on [property] above 80% — no usable equity to draw on without refinancing"
- "Portfolio is [concentrated in one suburb / one city / one property type] — consider diversification"

### 6. QUESTIONS FOR YOUR PROFESSIONALS

**For your mortgage broker:**
1. "If rates rise another 1–2%, which of my loans has a rate expiry or revert risk I should know about?"
2. "My IO loan on [property] expires in [month/year]. What are my options at that point?"
3. "Can I access equity from [property] to fund a deposit on the next purchase?"
4. "What would my serviceability look like if I wanted to add another property at $[price]?"

**For your accountant:**
1. "What is my total negative gearing position across the portfolio this year?"
2. "Are there any land tax issues with the current portfolio in [state]?"
3. "Given the proposed CGT changes, should I be thinking about timing on any of these properties?"

## How the numbers are worked out

Use these explicit definitions so two people running the same inputs get the same result.

```
weekly interest          = loan balance × annual rate ÷ 52
weekly loan repayment    = weekly interest                        (IO loan)
                         = amortised payment over remaining term  (P&I loan)
weekly cost              = weekly loan repayment + weekly outgoings
                           (weekly outgoings = annual outgoings ÷ 52)
pre-tax weekly cash flow = weekly rent (net of vacancy) − weekly cost
per +1% rate sensitivity = total loan balance × 1% ÷ 52          (extra $/week per portfolio)
```

**IO → P&I reversion:** at IO expiry, re-estimate the repayment by amortising the *remaining* loan balance over the *remaining* loan term (e.g. a 30-year loan with 5 IO years reverts to P&I over the remaining 25 years). Use the loan's current rate unless a revert rate is supplied.

**Today's-date check:** compare each IO expiry date to today. If an expiry date is already in the past, do not treat it as a future risk — surface it as "IO term may have already reverted or been renewed: confirm current loan status and repayment with your lender."

**Benchmark ranges (typical AU estimate — verify):**

| Input | Typical range | Note |
|---|---|---|
| Serviceability buffer lenders apply | +2.5% to +3% over rate | APRA guidance — verify current buffer |
| Usable-equity LVR ceiling | 80% (up to 90% with LMI) | lender-dependent |
| Vacancy stress allowance | 2–4 weeks/property/year | assumption — verify with property manager |

**Worked example (illustration only — verify every input):** A $500,000 IO loan at 6% → weekly interest = 500,000 × 0.06 ÷ 52 ≈ $577/week. A +1% rate rise adds 500,000 × 0.01 ÷ 52 ≈ $96/week. If weekly rent net of vacancy is $480 and other weekly outgoings are $90, pre-tax weekly cash flow ≈ 480 − (577 + 90) = −$187/week (illustration only — verify every input).

## Safety boundaries

- Never recommend selling a property or restructuring a portfolio
- Never advise on whether the portfolio is "performing well"
- Estimated values must be clearly flagged as user-provided estimates, not valuations
- Usable equity estimates require formal lender and valuation confirmation
